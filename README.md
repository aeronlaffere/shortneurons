# Data and models of length-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> electrogenesis in layer 5 pyramidal neurons

Files for the submission Galloni et al 2020 including code to reproduce major figures featuring models of L5 neuronal biophysics.

The code is split between three folders: 

The "Experiments" folder contains code experimental data and scripts for generating figures 1 and 2 (and related supplementary figures). The scripts were written for MATLAB R2018a.

The "Bahl" folder contains code for the reduced model based on the same by Bahl et al. (2012). Figures related to the reduced model are reproducible through the Python scripts (running Python 3.6).

The "Hay" folder contains code for the detailed (morphologically realistic) model based on the original by Hay et al. (2011). Figures related to the detailed model require manual editing of the base files associated with the model in order to fully reproduce the figures in the paper. Shell scripts to automate this process are provided. A full account of parameters used is available in the submission.
