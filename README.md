# Galloni.etal.2020

Files for the submission Galloni et al 2020 including code to reproduce major figures featuring models of L5 neuronal biophysics.

Code is split between two folders. The Hay folder contains code for the morphologically realistic model based on the original by Hay et al. The Bahl folder contains code for the reduced model based on the same by Bahl et al.

Though most figures are reproducible through Python scripts, those concerning the Hay model require manual editing of the base files associated with the model. A full account of parameters used is available in the submission.
